HANGMAN GAME

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a single-player version of the classic word-guessing game with a twist: you'll receive hints to help you guess the word. There are two levels to complete, each with words of different lengths. Your goal is to guess the word before you run out of lives. Let's dive into the details!

How to Play
Objective:

Guess the hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time.
You have a total of 6 lives. For each incorrect guess, you lose a life and a part of the hangman appears.
The game is lost if you lose all 6 lives (when the entire hangman is drawn).
Levels:

Level 1: Guess a 6-letter word.
Level 2: Guess an 8-letter word. This level is unlocked only after successfully completing Level 1.
Hints: Each word comes with a hint to help you guess the correct letters.
Gameplay:

Start by playing Level 1 (6-letter word).
If you guess the word correctly, you move on to Level 2 (8-letter word).
If you fail to guess the word within 6 lives in Level 1, the level will reset with a new 6-letter word and hint.
The same rules apply for Level 2, but you need to complete Level 1 to unlock it.
Lives and Hangman Drawing:

You start with 6 lives.
Each incorrect guess results in losing a life and drawing a part of the hangman.
The hangman is fully drawn (game over) after 6 incorrect guesses.

Future implementation

- Would like to implement a level 3 for 10 letter words and buttons to toggle across multiple levels
- Change the alert boxes to modal boxes
